I am an applied mathematician working in geophysical fluid dynamics and physical oceanography. I am currently a lecturer at Newcastle University. My work combines asymptotic analysis with numerical simulations and focuses on understanding the effects of turbulent mixing and boundary processes on the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere.

My research seeks to address the following questions:

* Mixed layer turbulence: the upper layer of the ocean is a region of elevated turbulence due to surface processes such as winds, heat transfer and evaporation. How does this turbulence affect the dynamics of upper ocean features such as fronts and instabilities?

* Parametrising small scale ocean features: can we use our understanding of the dynamics of small-scale ocean features to predict how these features interact with the large-scale dynamics such that only the large-scale dynamics need be resolved?

* Stability and breakdown of coherent structures: how do vortices decay or breakdown when interacting with waves and boundaries? Can we combine theoretical and numerical methods to determine the long-time stability of vortices? How can we combine a range mathematical techniques to calculate new vortex solutions?

* Coastal-trapped waves and topographic Rossby waves: how does the topography affect the propagation of waves and coastlines and continental shelves? How can we use numerical methods to find wave modes in complicated geometries?
