I use a variety of numerical tools in my work. This pages contains links to various software packages written by myself and others.

### [QGDipoles.jl](https://github.com/mncrowe/QGDipoles.jl)

I have recently written a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package to calculate dipolar vortex solutions to various quasi-geostrophic models, including the equivalent barotropic model, multi-layer QG and surface QG. The original MATLAB version of this code is available [here](https://github.com/mncrowe/QGDipoles.m).

### [Spectral Methods for Coastal Trapped Waves](https://github.com/mncrowe/CTWSpectralMethods.m)

This MATLAB code uses spectral methods to determine coastal-trapped wave solutions in the presence of complicated bottom topography, stratification and background flow. The method and applications are outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07199) in joint work with [Ted Johnson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucaherj/). I am looking to implement this method in an open source language, contact me if this is something you'd find useful.

### [GeophysicalFlows.jl](https://github.com/FourierFlows/GeophysicalFlows.jl)

I have contributed to GeophysicalFlows, a spectral solver for quasi-geostrophic models which utilises GPUs for fast computation. GeophysicalFlows is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and built on [FourierFlows.jl](https://github.com/FourierFlows).

### [Machine Learning for Submesoscale Modelling](https://github.com/mncrowe/ML_Submesoscales)

During the NFFDy Summer School in Cambridge in 2023, I worked with [Lois Baker](https://loisbaker.github.io/) and [Carolanne Vouriot](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mac/people/civil-academic-staff/carolanne-vouriot) using machine learning techniques to estimate up/downwelling in submesoscale simulations. This directory contains [Julia](https://julialang.org/) setup files for submesoscale simulations in [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl), MATLAB data analysis files, and Python files for implementing a convolutional neural network using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Why use one language when you can use three? A writeup of the project is available [here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/e8ba27d6-ea44-4ace-bb87-578bbb3576f3).

### [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.org/)

I am a frequent user of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) package Dedalus, a general spectral PDE solver. Some of my example Dedalus scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/mncrowe/Dedalus_Scripts). Dedalus scripts relating to my published work are available upon request though are likely written in Dedalus v2, which has now been mostly superseded by v3.


### [VisualPDE](https://visualpde.com/)

I have worked with [Ben Walker](https://benjaminwalker.info/) and [Andrew Krause](https://www.andrewkrause.org/)
