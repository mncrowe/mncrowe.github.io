In 2022/23 I taught Fluid Mechanics <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maths/sites/maths/files/math0015.pdf">(MATH0015)</a> at UCL. UCL students should see the Moodle page for course content.

In 2023/24 I taught Geophysical Fluid Dynamics [(MAS8810)](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/newcastle/study-abroad/MAS8810) at Newcastle University. Students should see the course page on Canvas.

In 2024/25 I taught Partial Differential Equations <a href = "https://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/newcastle/study-abroad/MAS3806">(MAS3806)</a> and Differential Equations, Waves and Transforms <a href = "https://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/newcastle/study-abroad/MAS2802">(MAS2802)</a> at Newcastle University. Students should see the course pages on Canvas. I have written Matlab example scripts for [the method of characteristics](https://github.com/mncrowe/Method_of_Characteristics) and [second-order PDEs](https://github.com/mncrowe/2nd_Order_PDEs).
